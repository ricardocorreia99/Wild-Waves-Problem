# Wild-Waves-Problem
Two time series have been given:
* One with the predicted wave height (in metres) versus time (in hours).
*  One with the threshold wave height (in metres) versus time (in hours).  The aim is to find the longest uninterrupted period during which the predicted wave height is at least 1 metre and below the threshold.
